I'm an experimental and computational psycholinguist currently finishing my PhD at [Saarland University](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/).  I primarily use behavioral experiments and probabilistic models to look at how people combine expectations about speaker efficiency, world knowledge, and discourse in interpreting the meaning of complex utterances.

I received my MA in Linguistics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2013. After working as a Language Engineer at Intel in Hudson, MA for a year, I moved to Germany in 2014. I am a native English and Russian speaker, and semi-proficient German speaker. 

In my off-time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and playing board games.  I like data, sci-fi, and cats.
