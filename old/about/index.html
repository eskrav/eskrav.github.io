            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Currently, I'm doing my PhD research in the Computational Linguistics department at Saarland University.</p>

<p>I'm an experimental and computational psycholinguist interested in communicative efficiency and pragmatics, particularly in how people combine expectations about speaker efficiency, world knowledge, and discourse structure in interpreting the meaning of utterances. I use web-based rating and passage completion experiments, eye-tracking, and self-paced reading studies to look at at how world knowledge, primarily in the form of stereotyped event sequences (scripts), influences production and comprehension of informationally redundant utterances.  Some of our work is summarized in <a href="research/KravtchenkoDemberg2017.pdf">this paper</a> (under revision, please do not cite without permission).</p>


<p>I'm also working on a project which looks at the (potentially asymmetrical) role of discourse predictability in speaker production and listener comprehension of referring expressions.  You can watch a 12-minutes summary of our progress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xC4xsEhOp4&t=210m37s">here</a>.</p>


<p>In 2013 I received my MA in Linguistics from the University of California at Santa Cruz, where I looked at the role that communicative efficiency, or specifically the information carried by linguistic elements (in the information-theoretic sense), plays in online language production.  My thesis work (summarized in the CogSci 2014 paper found <a href="https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2014/papers/143/paper143.pdf">here</a>) focused on the role that contextual predictability plays in the omission of optional subjects in Russian.</p>


<p>From 2013 to 2014, I was employed by Intel Corporation, in Hudson, MA, as a Software Engineer/Linguist.  Unfortunately, I can't talk much about this here ;-).</p>

<p>At the moment I live in Kaiserslautern, Germany, a five-minute walk from the Palatinate forest.  In my free time I go hiking, climb rock walls, and play board games.  I like data, sci-fi, and cats.</p>
